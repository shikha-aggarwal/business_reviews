"""
Yelp Fusion API code sample.

This program demonstrates the capability of the Yelp Fusion API
by using the Search API to query for businesses by a search term and location,
and the Business API to query additional information about the top result
from the search query.

Please refer to http://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/documentation for the API
documentation.

This program requires the Python requests library, which you can install via:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Sample usage of the program:
`python sample.py --term="bars" --location="San Francisco, CA"`
